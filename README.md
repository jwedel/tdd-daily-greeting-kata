## User Story 1

As a very cocky person, I want a program that I can call at any time and that displays a very respectful greeting "Good day, sir!" so that I am pleased.

## User Story 2

As a lazy employee, I want to be reminded when it's friday so I can stop working so hard and focus on my weekend plans.

## User Story 3

As a traditionalist, I want to get a new greeting on Christmas eve to not forget to open my presents.

## User Story 4

As an oblivious person, I want to be reminded of my birthday so I can complain about people forgetting to buy me presents.
